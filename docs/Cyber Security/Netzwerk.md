# Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a powerful web application security testing tool used for finding vulnerabilities. It helps intercept, analyze, and modify HTTP/S requests and responses between a browser and the target server. Burp is widely used by penetration testers and developers.

1. Target
   Purpose: Organizes and scopes the target for testing.
   Features:
    - Displays a site map of all discovered URLs and endpoints.
    - Allows marking specific targets in-scope for testing.
    - Useful for planning attacks.
2. Proxy
   Purpose: Intercepts and modifies HTTP/S traffic between your browser and the server.
   Features:
    - Intercept requests and responses.
    - Modify headers, parameters, or payloads in real-time.
    - Replay requests for testing different inputs.
3. Repeater
   Purpose: Manually modify and re-send HTTP/S requests.
   Features:
    - Experiment with parameter changes.
    - Observe how the server responds to different inputs.
    - Useful for testing vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.
4. Intruder
   Purpose: Automates sending customized payloads to find vulnerabilities.
   Features:
    - Perform brute-force attacks.
    - Test for injection points (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
    - Uses payload positions and attack types (Sniper, Cluster Bomb, etc.).
5. Scanner (Pro version)
   Purpose: Automates vulnerability scanning.
   Features:
    - Identifies common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi).
    - Provides detailed findings and remediation advice.
    - Only available in Burp Suite Professional.
6. Decoder
   Purpose: Encodes/decodes and converts data into various formats.
   Features:
    - Supports Base64, URL encoding, HTML, etc.
    - Useful for decoding obfuscated payloads.
7. Comparer
   Purpose: Compares two sets of data (requests, responses, etc.).
   Features:
    - Highlights differences between inputs or outputs.
    - Useful for analyzing changes after parameter modifications.
